# dsh-plugin-opencode-local

[![Listed on dsh-plugin.org](https://dsh-plugin.org/badges/listed.svg)](https://dsh-plugin.org/plugins/mateenahmed737/dsh-plugin-opencode-local)

## Why this exists

I wanted to use OpenCode's models in DeepSeek Harness through the OpenCode CLI installed on my own machine, the way [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) does. I couldn't find a DeepSeek Harness plugin that did that, so I built this one.

## What it does

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai) (DSH) plugin that adds an **OpenCode (local)** model provider. Every request is served by your own installed [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the same way [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) does it: one `opencode serve` on `127.0.0.1`, started from your install with your own login and config, driven only through OpenCode's official clients.

- Your models: every model of every provider you are signed in to in OpenCode, plus OpenCode's own free models, with OpenCode's `provider/model` ids.
- Your login: the plugin never reads, copies or forwards `auth.json` or any credential. OpenCode uses its own.
- Your machine: all model traffic goes through your `opencode` process. The plugin makes no calls to `opencode.ai` or any other host, uses no proxies, and sets no custom headers or user agent.

## Compatibility

| | |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek Harness | 0.2.x (tested on 0.2.1-rc.5) |
| DSH profiles | Desktop app and CLI/headless profiles |
| OpenCode | 1.14.19 or newer, including 2.x |
| Platforms | Windows (tested end to end), Linux (CI); macOS should work but is untested |
| Node | 22.19 or newer (DSH ships its own) |

Restricted OpenCode tools (shell, file edits, web fetch) go through DSH's approval prompt; see [Permission policy](#permission-policy).

## Install

1. Install OpenCode and check it runs:

   ```sh
   npm i -g opencode-ai     # or see https://opencode.ai/docs/#install
   opencode --version
   opencode auth login      # only for paid providers; the free models need no login
   ```

2. Add the plugin to DSH.
   - **DSH desktop app:** open the plugin manager and add `dsh-plugin-opencode-local`.
   - **DSH CLI:**

     ```sh
     dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-opencode-local
     ```

     Use the name of your own profile in place of `web`, for example `desktop` or `headless`.

   To try an unreleased version, build it (`npm ci && npm pack`) and add the `.tgz` file instead.

3. Restart DSH, open the model picker, and choose a model under **OpenCode (local)**.

   The provider also shows up in **Settings → Models**, where **Edit** opens its settings:

The plugin has no install scripts and downloads nothing. If `opencode` can't be found, the first request tells you how to install it or where to point `binaryPath`.

## Settings

In DSH under Settings → Models → OpenCode (local), or in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml` under `dsh-plugin-opencode-local`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `binaryPath` | `opencode` | Path or PATH name of your `opencode` executable. |
| `serverUrl` | empty | Attach to an `opencode serve` you already run (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4096`) instead of starting one. |
| `serverPassword` | empty | That server's password (`OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` for 1.x, `OPENCODE_PASSWORD` for 2.x). |
| `cwd` | empty | Working directory for OpenCode sessions. Empty uses the DSH conversation's working directory. |
| `allowRestrictedTools` | `false` | Allow the restricted tools (below) without asking. |
| `askForApproval` | `true` | Ask in DSH's approval prompt before a restricted tool runs. When off, they're rejected. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `1800000` | Upper bound for one turn, in ms. `0` means no limit. |
| `modelRefreshSeconds` | `300` | How often the model list is re-read from OpenCode. |
| `showToolActivity` | `true` | Show OpenCode's tool calls as short lines in the reply. |
| `localSessionTitles` | `true` | Make DSH session titles locally instead of spending a model request on them. |

## How it works

- **One shared server.** On the first request the plugin runs `opencode --version`, then `opencode serve --hostname=127.0.0.1 --port=<free port>` with your full environment and a new random password. It waits for the "listening" line and checks `/global/health` (1.x) or `/api/info` (2.x). If the server crashes it is restarted with backoff. When DSH stops or the plugin is disabled, the whole process group (or process tree on Windows) is killed.
- **Sessions.** Each DSH conversation gets its own OpenCode session in the conversation's working directory. Only the new message is sent each turn. If the DSH history no longer matches what OpenCode has seen (DSH restarted, a message was edited, the conversation was compacted, or a turn failed), a new session is created and seeded with the DSH transcript.
- **Streaming.** Text, reasoning, tool activity and token usage stream into DSH. Stopping a reply in DSH aborts the OpenCode run.
- **Images.** png, jpeg, gif and webp up to 20 MB are sent to models that accept images.

## Permission policy

The same policy as T3 Code's default (non full-access) mode:

- **Always allowed:** `question`, `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `lsp`, `todowrite`, `task`, `skill`. Reading `.env` files still asks; `.env.example` doesn't.
- **Restricted:** `bash` (`shell` in 2.x), `edit`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `codesearch`, `external_directory`, `doom_loop`, and anything not listed.

Restricted tools are configured as `ask`, never `deny`. (A `deny` rule makes OpenCode's free tier refuse requests with `FreeTierError`.) When OpenCode asks:

1. if `allowRestrictedTools` is on, it's allowed once;
2. otherwise, if DSH's approval prompt is available and `askForApproval` is on, you decide;
3. otherwise it's rejected, and the model gets a message saying the tool was not granted and not to retry.

For 1.x the policy is passed in `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` (your own `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, if set, is kept and only its `permission` key replaced). For 2.x it's set as session permission rules. The plugin never uses `--auto` or allow-all.

OpenCode questions (the `question` tool) can't be shown in DSH, so they're declined and the model continues without an answer.

## Errors

OpenCode's error message is shown as is.

| OpenCode | DSH failure |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP 429, `FreeUsageLimitError` | `RATE_LIMIT`. The plugin doesn't retry it; wait and try again. |
| HTTP 401/403, `FreeTierError`, `ProviderAuthError` | `AUTH` |
| network errors, timeouts, lost connection to the local server | `TRANSPORT` (retried once by DSH) |
| HTTP 5xx | `SERVER` |
| `<none>` (OpenCode couldn't read the provider's reply) | a readable message with the HTTP status, as in T3 Code |

## Troubleshooting

- **"OpenCode was not found".** Install it (above), or set `binaryPath` to the full path. On Windows that's usually `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\opencode.cmd`.
- **"OpenCode vX is too old".** Run `opencode upgrade` or `npm i -g opencode-ai@latest`.
- **No models in the picker.** Run `opencode models` in a terminal. If that's empty too, sign in with `opencode auth login`. The list refreshes every `modelRefreshSeconds`.
- **"database is locked".** Another OpenCode process is busy with the same data directory. Try again, or attach to your running server with `serverUrl`.
- **A tool keeps getting rejected.** That's the policy. Approve it in DSH's prompt, or turn on `allowRestrictedTools` if you trust the model with your shell and files.
- **Rate limits on free models.** These come from OpenCode's free tier. The message is OpenCode's own; wait, or sign in to a provider with your own key.

The plugin never logs prompts, credentials or the server password. Server output shown in startup errors has the password removed.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run check   # typecheck, build to lib/, unit tests
```

The tests run against a fake `opencode` (`test/fixtures/fake-opencode.mjs`) that speaks both the 1.x and 2.x APIs.

## Credits

- [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) inspired this plugin. The way it runs OpenCode follows T3 Code's OpenCode provider: starting your own `opencode serve` on 127.0.0.1, the permission policy, the OpenCode 1.x/2.x handling and the error messages. Parts are adapted from its code (MIT, © 2026 T3 Tools Inc.).
- [@quonaro/dsh-plugin-opencode](https://github.com/quonaro/dsh-plugin-opencode) showed the DSH plugin shape and local session titles (MIT).
