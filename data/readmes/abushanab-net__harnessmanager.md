# Harness Manager

**Run Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and Antigravity under several accounts on one computer, side by side.**<br>
See every account's limits, usage and sessions in one window, and keep one set of MCP servers, skills and
prompts for all of them.

</div>

## Why

Tools like Claude Code keep one login per settings folder. With a work subscription, a personal one and an
API key, switching means logging out and in, and you lose track of which account still has room.

- **One folder per account.** Every account runs in its own folder, so several run in parallel and nothing
  global changes.
- **Know where the room is.** The 5-hour and weekly limits of every account, when they free up, and which
  account to start next.
- **One place for your setup.** MCP servers, skills and prompts are kept once and written into every tool
  in that tool's own format.
- **A window and a CLI.** Everything the desktop app does, `hrm` does from a terminal, with `--json` for
  scripts.

## Install

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/abushanab-net/HarnessManager/releases/latest).

| System | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows 10/11** | `Harness.Manager_<version>_x64-setup.exe` | Supported and tested. Installs `HarnessManager.exe` and `hrm.exe` for the current user. |
| Windows on ARM | `Harness.Manager_<version>_arm64-setup.exe` | Since 1.9.4. Cross-compiled; not yet tested on an ARM device. |
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `Harness.Manager_<version>_aarch64.dmg` | Built but untested. Drag the app into Applications. Signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple. |
| Linux | `.AppImage` or `.deb` | Built but untested. |

API keys can only be saved on Windows for now, because macOS and Linux have no credential store wired in yet.

Silent install on Windows:

```powershell
& ".\Harness.Manager_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe" /S /D="$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Harness Manager"
```

The app updates itself: it checks for a new version at launch and every hour, and installs only updates
signed by the release key.

## Quick start

1. **Start Harness Manager.** It adds a main account for each tool it finds installed.
2. **Accounts → Add account:** name it, pick the tool and sign in. Claude accounts sign in inside the app.
3. **Start** opens a terminal as that account. **Start in a folder** picks a project first.
4. **Overview** shows the live routes, every limit on one seven-day line, and which account has the most room.
5. **MCP servers**, **Skills** and **System prompts:** add something once and tick the tools it should reach.

Press `Ctrl K` to find an account, session or setting. The **?** button replays the page's tour.

## Features

- **Accounts per tool, each in its own folder:** Claude Code (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), Codex (`CODEX_HOME`)
  and OpenCode (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME`) accounts run in parallel. Antigravity keeps one login,
  so starting another Antigravity account swaps the saved login. Accounts can be renamed and are grouped by
  tool.
- **Limits:** Claude limits come from the numbers Claude Code saves, and can optionally be read live with
  the saved login while it is valid. Codex limits come from its session logs. One timeline shows when every
  limit frees up, and an API-key account can have a daily spending cap.
- **Usage, on Accounts:** each account's tokens per day, its tokens and cost for the last 7, 14 or 30 days
  beside its limits, the split by model, and a CSV export; the Overview adds a heatmap and a request log.
  Each account's own logs are read once and counted once.
- **Projects:** every folder your tools ran in, with its sessions, tokens and cost at API list prices, a
  distribution of where the tokens and the cost went, and a card per project. Pin a project to the sidebar;
  open one to see only its sessions.
- **Sessions:** every tool's sessions in one place, grouped by project, date, account, tool or tag, with a
  project rail beside the list and the running ones pinned at the top; the live count in the sidebar and the
  top bar lead straight to them. Tag sessions and projects with your own labels. A reading view shows the
  steps, failed commands, answers and changed files, and follows a running session live. Resume reopens a
  session in its own account.
- **MCP servers, skills and prompts, kept once:** each MCP server is written into every tool you tick.
  Skills live once in `~\.agents\skills` and are linked into each tool; Discover installs skills from
  GitHub repositories. A ledger records what Harness Manager wrote, so it only ever removes its own entries.
- **Apps:** every copy of each tool on this computer and how it was installed (the vendor's installer, npm,
  winget, Homebrew, Scoop or Chocolatey), its version and the newest one from its vendor, and install, update
  or remove a duplicate copy in a terminal you can watch.
- **API keys and a local router:** API-key accounts keep their key in Windows Credential Manager, and only
  the launched process receives it. A local router on 127.0.0.1 sends routed accounts to providers, moves to
  the next one when a provider fails, and converts between the Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Chat Completions
  formats. Subscription logins never pass through it. DeepSeek is a built-in preset (`hrm provider` shows
  the command): its OpenAI-format endpoint, its Anthropic-format one for Claude Code routes, both models and
  their list prices, with cache hits counted from the usage it returns.
- **Backups:** automatic and manual, of the account list, settings, what Harness Manager wrote into each
  tool, and the skills it manages. Backups never hold keys or logins. Since 1.6 a backup also holds the
  history: every request with the computer it ran on and the cost it was valued at, the sessions, the limit
  readings, the tags, the other computers (names and certificates, never keys) and the archived sessions;
  with Include transcripts on, this computer's session transcripts too. With a sync folder chosen, every
  backup is also copied to `backups\<this computer>` there, so a fresh computer finds its history beside the
  journal. **Restore is a merge:** Settings › Backups and archive › Restore… takes a backup (this computer's
  or one from the sync folder), the sync folder itself, or a zip or folder from elsewhere, shows what it holds
  (computers, requests, tokens, sessions, limit history, archived transcripts, the newest date) and merges it
  by the same rules sync uses, so nothing is counted twice and restoring again adds nothing. When the source
  names this computer, "Restore and continue as <name>" takes over that identity (its id, a new incarnation,
  so the other computers see a continuation); otherwise the restored computer stays a past computer in the
  lists. **The archive** moves the transcripts of sessions older than an age you choose (30 days by default;
  Never keeps everything where it is) out of the tools' folders into `archive\<this computer>` in the sync
  folder and into a folder of your choice, compressed by project and month, each copy checked before the
  original is deleted, once a day while the app runs and with Archive now. The session stays in the list with
  an "archived" pill and its numbers, and reads from the archive; it cannot be resumed from there. Usage is
  never touched. **Welcome back:** when a sync folder is chosen (or at first launch with one already set and
  nothing published yet) and it holds history, the app offers to restore it and continue as the computer of
  that name, to restore it as a new computer, or to start fresh. From a terminal: `hrm backup
  [--with-transcripts]`, `hrm restore <zip|folder> [--adopt] [--preview]` and `hrm archive status | now`.
- **Computers:** point every computer at one shared folder (OneDrive, Google Drive, SMB, a NAS) and each
  publishes its usage, sessions, limit readings and tags there as an append-only journal, which the others
  merge into their own database. Every request keeps its id and the cost it was valued at, so nothing is
  counted twice and nothing is re-priced. Settings › Computers names this computer, picks the folder, and shows
  a card per computer with when it was last heard from and how much of its history has arrived; Sync now runs
  a round at once. With sync on, the Overview adds every computer up and gets an "All computers · This
  computer" switch, each tile splits its number by computer, the Activity grid switches between all computers
  and one, Live routes dot each account with the computers it runs on, Sessions gain a Computer column and
  filter (a session open elsewhere says "running on <name>"), project cards show which computers have the
  repository, and a chip in the top bar shows which computers were heard from in the last three minutes.
  With sync off, nothing changes. `hrm computers status | now | set` does the same from a terminal.
  **Direct connection:** turn it on in Settings › Computers and two computers talk to each other straight
  over the network, so live routes and presence arrive within seconds instead of a folder round. Pair them
  once with a six-digit code (Pair a computer… shows it on one computer and takes it on the other, with an
  address for a computer on another network); each then holds the other's certificate, and every connection
  is mutual TLS that only paired computers can open. They find each other by mDNS on the same network; across
  a VPN (Pangolin, Tailscale and the like) give the computer's card an address, a stable name or IP, and it is
  reached there. Each card says how the computer is reached ("direct · mDNS · connected", "relayed through
  LAPTOP", "folder · heard 40 s ago"), and Running now and the chip follow presence every ten seconds.
  Journal chunks are signed by the computer they come from, and a computer reachable only through another
  paired computer is relayed, so three computers need not all see each other; one reached neither way is
  still merged through the folder, just not live. Forget removes a computer and its certificate (what was
  merged from it stays). From a terminal: `hrm computers pair [--host name]`, `hrm computers join <code>
  [--host name:port]`, `hrm computers peers`, `hrm computers forget <name>`, and `hrm computers serve
  --seconds <n>` runs the listener without the app.

  **Resuming elsewhere.** With Carry transcripts on, each computer also puts its session transcripts in the
  folder (compressed; a transcript over 20 MB stays home, and the folder holds up to 200 MB per computer, the
  oldest going first). A session from another computer can then be read here, fetched the first time, and
  resumed here with **Resume here** when this computer has the same repository and an account of that name
  for that tool; otherwise the row says why ("not cloned here", "no account work for Claude Code on this
  computer", "running on LAPTOP"). Resuming is a fork: the transcript is copied where the tool looks for it
  here (Claude Code is started with `--resume <copy> --fork-session`, Codex with `-C <clone> resume <id>`,
  OpenCode imports the export, Pi and Oh My Pi get the log under their sessions folder; Antigravity is
  read-only) and the original on the other computer is never written. Only the conversation comes across:
  files changed since, attachments and running shells do not, so pull the branch first. A session continued
  this way says "continued from LAPTOP" under its title. `hrm resume-here <computer>/<tool>/<account>/<id>`
  and `hrm transcripts` do the same from a terminal.

  **A hub you host.** The second choice beside the folder: a small service on a VPS behind Caddy, in Docker
  (`deploy/hub/`), that every computer pushes its journal to and pulls the others' from, with presence,
  transcripts and the addresses the direct connection meets at, from any network and without a VPN. The first
  computer joins with the hub's admin token (Settings › Computers › A hub you host › Join with a code…) and
  makes the **ring key** that seals everything before it leaves: chunks, presence and transcripts reach the hub
  as ciphertext the hub cannot open, and only the signed device records (names, ids, keys, project roots) are
  plain. The key is shown once as the **recovery key**, 8 groups of 4 letters and digits for your password
  manager; Show again sits in Settings behind a confirm. Every other computer joins with a one-time six-digit
  code from Invite a computer… on a computer already there, and reads the hub either because it was paired
  directly (the pairing carries the ring key) or after Enter recovery key…. While the app runs it keeps the hub's
  events socket open and pulls on each change, falling back to a round every 30 s; a computer's card says "hub ·
  connected", and with the direct connection on, paired computers meet at the addresses the hub holds
  ("direct · rendezvous · connected") before trying mDNS. What the hub can see: who the computers are, how much
  each sent and when. What it cannot: a single request, session, prompt or transcript. From a terminal: `hrm hub
  join <url> --code <c> | --admin <t>`, `hrm hub invite`, `hrm hub status`, `hrm hub leave`, `hrm ring show`,
  `hrm ring enter`.
  [deploy/hub/README.md](deploy/hub/README.md) sets one up in ten lines.
- **Desktop comforts:** closes to the tray, launches at sign-in, dark or light or as Windows is, a
  diagnostic log, and a guided tour of each page.

## Supported tools

| | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Antigravity | Pi | Oh My Pi |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Several accounts at once | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | one at a time | ✓ | ✓ |
| Subscription login | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `/login` in the tool | `/login` in the tool |
| API-key account | ✓ | ✓ | | | ✓ | |
| 5-hour and weekly limits | ✓ | ✓ | | | | |
| Tokens and cost | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Sessions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| MCP servers and skills | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Prompt file | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `GEMINI.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` |

Pi and Oh My Pi share one session format, so one parser reads both; each account is its own
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.

**DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`)** is not supported yet. It runs as a desktop app, a web UI or headless, and does not
document where it stores sessions or in what format, so there is nothing stable to read; its session logs are
also uploaded to DeepSeek by default. It is gated the way Antigravity's usage is, and will be revisited when
its session store is documented. DeepSeek's models are available today through the router preset above.

To add a tool, write an adapter in `crates/core/src/harness/` next to `claude.rs` and `codex.rs`.

## Command line

`hrm` does everything the app does. Add `--json` for scripts.

```powershell
hrm list                                   # accounts, plans, limits, tokens, open consoles
hrm add work --email you@example.com       # a Claude Code account (signs in)
hrm add codex-personal --harness codex
hrm run work                               # Claude Code as that account, in this console
hrm start work --cwd D:\Projects\my-app     # ... in a new terminal
hrm sessions --group project               # --open for the running ones, --project <key>, --tag <tag>
hrm projects list --days 7                 # sessions, tokens and list-price cost per project
hrm tag session work/<session id> release  # or: hrm tag project <key> client-x
hrm usage --days 7 --json
hrm mcp list; hrm skills list
hrm help <command>
```

## FAQ

**Where are my logins and keys?** Logins stay where each tool saved them, in that account's folder.
Harness Manager never refreshes, copies or stores a subscription login. API keys are in Windows Credential
Manager, never in files, command-line arguments, logs or backups.

**What does it store?** `%APPDATA%\HarnessManager` holds `profiles.json` (the account list),
`settings.json`, `hm.db` (usage and sessions), `backups\` and `logs\`. In Settings you can point the account
list at a OneDrive folder to share accounts between computers; keys and logins never leave the computer.

**What goes over the network?** Update checks for Harness Manager (GitHub releases) and for the tools on the
Apps page. Live Claude limits are off unless you turn them on. The router only sends what an API-key account
asks it to send.

**Does it change my existing setup?** It adds its own entries and records them in a ledger. It never removes
your own MCP servers, skills or settings.

**I used the old `claude-accounts.ps1` launcher.** Its accounts are imported on first start.

## How it works

![The parts: the desktop app and hrm call hrm-core, which drives the tool adapters, keeps the account list and hm.db, starts the router and reads keys from Credential Manager](docs/diagrams/architecture.png)

The app and `hrm` are thin; all the rules are in `hrm-core`, so the window and the command line behave the
same. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) walks through each part, and these diagrams show the main
flows:
- [Starting an account](docs/diagrams/launch.png): each account gets its own folder through its environment.
- [Shared MCP servers, skills and prompts](docs/diagrams/shared-items.png): kept once, written into each
  tool in its own format, with a ledger of what was written.
- [The local router](docs/diagrams/router.png): failover, the token, and the format conversion.
- [CI and releases](docs/diagrams/release.png): from a pull request to a signed update on every installed copy.

The pages read an index, not the tools' folders. The `sessions` table in `hm.db` holds every session the
tools' scans found (this computer's, the other computers' merged journals, and the archived ones) with the
columns the pages filter and sort on, plus an FTS5 table for the search; a page open is one query, paged at
50 rows, however many session files exist. A folder watcher on the tools' session folders (`notify`) puts a
changed file into the index within about a second, re-reading only that file from its cursor, and the window
redraws in place; the five-minute refresh walks every folder as the safety net. `hrm index status` shows the
rows per tool, the last refresh and whether the watcher is on; `hrm index refresh` walks now, `--all` reads
every file again.

Layout:
- `crates/core`: `hrm-core`, all the rules (tool adapters, accounts, usage, sessions, shared setup, apps,
  backups, the launcher)
- `crates/cli`: `hrm`
- `crates/router`: the local router
- `crates/fakeharness`: the test stand-in for claude, codex, opencode and agy
- `app/`: the Tauri desktop app (`src-tauri`) and its interface (`ui`, plain JavaScript)
- `e2e/`: the desktop app's end-to-end tests
- `scripts/`: build and test

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. For a security problem, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

**Build and test.** You need Rust (stable), Node.js 24 or later, PowerShell 7 and WebView2 (part of
Windows 11).

```powershell
pwsh scripts/build.ps1             # release hrm.exe and the NSIS installer
pwsh scripts/test.ps1              # core, CLI and router tests, then the desktop app UI tests
pwsh scripts/test.ps1 -Installed   # the same, then the UI tests again against the installed app
cd e2e; npm install                # once, for the UI tests (playwright-core)
```

The UI tests (`e2e/app.e2e.mjs`) start the real app in a sandbox, with a fake tool standing in for each
harness, and drive the window over the WebView2 DevTools protocol. Screenshots of every screen land in
`e2e/.work/shots`; `HRM_README_SHOT=1` refreshes the one in this README. The interface in `app/ui` is
built into the app, so run `cargo build -p hrm-app` before running the UI tests on their own.

**Pull requests.**
1. Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once per clone; every push then runs `scripts/test.ps1`.
2. Branch from `develop` (or fork) and open a pull request into `develop`. CI must pass, and a pull request
   needs one approving review.
3. Rules go in `crates/core` with a test; anything visible in the window gets a step in `e2e/app.e2e.mjs`;
   a bug fix comes with the test that would have caught it.
4. Keep the security rules in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). A change that breaks one is not merged.
5. Write commit messages as a short sentence about what the user gets, and keep each change small.

**CI and releases.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds and tests every pull request and every push to
`develop`. Pull requests from forks run on GitHub's own runners. To release, tag a commit on `develop`
(`git tag v1.0.1; git push origin v1.0.1`): `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds Windows, macOS and Linux,
signs the update files and publishes the release with the `latest.json` that installed copies check. Only
maintainers can push release tags.
